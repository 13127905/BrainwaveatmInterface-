# BrainwaveatmInterface-
A fully functional ATM interface developed as part of my internship project. Built using Python and Tkinter, this project simulates real-world ATM functionalities including PIN authentication, cash withdrawal, balance inquiry, deposit handling, and interactive sound feedback. The UI mimics an actual ATM layout.
